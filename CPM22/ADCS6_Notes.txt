Notes by Howard M. Harte, circa 2007/2008.

Assemble the CBIOS:

m80 suprbios,suprbios=suprbios
l80 suprbios,suprbios/n/e (remove first three bytes from generated .COM file.)
BIOS @EA00
BDOS @DC00
CCP  @D400

RMAC os2ccp
a:link os2ccp[L0,P0]

RMAC os3bdos
a:link os3ccp[L0,P0]

Now put the CCP, BDOS, and CBIOS into a binary file called CPM.SYS

CCP:  file offset 0
BDOS: file offset 800h
BIOS: file offset 1600h

I have saved a file called CPMCB.BIN which has the CCP and BDOS at the correct locations.  Just
paste the BIOS at the end.

Notes:

trk0.ldr is the loader for 8"
trk048.ldr is for 5.25" Ds/DD
trk096.ldr is for 5.25" Ds/HD
