System Generation
-----------------

1.  	To assemble and link your SuperBios version 3.44 of MicroSoft's 
	M80.COM and L80.COM is needed. Releases previous to this version
	will not assemble various pseudo ops used in the bios.

2.	Set the default user number and default drive number equates
	(dfun, dfdn) to the drive and user number to attach to after a 
	coldboot.  The drive number must be one of the logical drives
	specified in the drive configuration macro, 'dskdef'.

3.	Set the floppy step rate equate (fstpr) to a value that will 
	work for all floppys attached to the system.  Legitmate values
	are in the range 0-3 and correspond to the following step rates:

	fstpr	8" step rate	5" step rate
	-----	------------	------------

	0	 3 ms		 6 ms
	1	 6 ms		12 ms
	2	10 ms		20 ms
	3	15 ms		30 ms

	The value the fstpr is set to will be used by all floppys configured
	on the system, both 8" and 5". 

4.	Set the '.Phase' pseudo-op to the address of where the Bios will
	operate. If using a CPM60.COM file, this address will be 0EA00h,
	if using CPM61.COM set this address to 0EE00h, CPM59.COM --- 0E600h,
 	ect. This pseudo-op is located immediately before the bios 
	jump vector in the source file.

5. 	Set the 'dskdef' macro near the end of the source file to the
	type of drive(s) to be configured on the system.  The  logical 
	mapping of the drives is given by the left to right ordering of
	the physical drives in the macro parameters.  The maximum size
	of a logical storage device under CP/M 2.2 is 8.3M, so keep in
	mind that certain hard disk drives will automaticaly be partioned
	into multiple logical drives.  
	
	i.e., if two 8" floppies, and 1 ST503 hard drive are to be 
	configured, set the dskdef macro to:

	dskdef	<f8,f8,st503>

	The first 8" floppy (f8) will be logical drive A:, the second
	floppy will be logical drive B:, and the hard disk (st503) will 
	be logical drives C: and D:.  The hard disk is divided into two 
	drives because its formated capacity exceeds CP/M 2.2 storage 
	devices size limitation.

	Refer to the SuperBios library for the various hard drives that 
	can be configured.

6.	Assemble the bios using M80 with the following command line:

	M80 =SUPRBIOS/L

	The /L switch will produce a .PRN file with the macros expanded.

7.	Link the bios using L80 with the following command line:

	L80 /P:100,SUPRBIOS,SUPRBIOS/N/E

8.	Do a MOVCPM ?? *, where ?? is the size of the cpm system to create
	and save as a CPM??.COM file. The size of the system created should
	reflect the value of the address set in 2.

9.	Patch the Bios and CP/M together as follows:

	ddt CPM??.COM
	DDT VERS 2.2
	NEXT PC
	2300 0100
	-M980,1F7F,100
	-ISUPRBIOS.COM
	-R1600
	NEXT PC
	???? 0100
	-G0
	A>SAVE ?? XCPM.SYS

	The value to save will vary depending on your system configuration,
	and can be calculated as follows: EX. if ???? = 2A80, then
	use the high byte of the address, 2A, and round up if the low byte is
	not 0, in this case to 2B, convert from hexadecimal to decimal,
 	(2*16) + (11*1) = 43 decimal, and subtract 1, for the result,
	which is 42 in this example.  Thus, you would type SAVE 42 XCPM.SYS
 	at the A> prompt.

10.	You now have a complete os ready to be renamed to CPM.SYS
	and executed.


I/O Byte Implementation
-----------------------

The logical to physical device mapping can temporarily be changed until
the next coldboot via the stat command.The physical to logical device
mapping as viewed from "STAT" is as follows: 
	

       sioa  siob  pioab not used	(physical device names)
       ----- ----  ----- --------

con: = tty:  crt:  bat:  uc1:		(logical device names for con:)
rdr: = tty:  ptr:  ur1:  ur2:		(logical device names for rdr:)
pun: = tty:  ptp:  up1:  up2:		(logical device names for pun:)
lst: = tty:  crt:  lpt:  uc1:		(logical device names for lst:)


To change the LST: device mapping from the parallel channel to the 
second serial channel, execute the following command:


stat lst:=crt:


To change the LST: device back to the parrallel channel, do the following
at the system prompt:


stat lst:=lpt:


To change the mapping of the rdr: and pun: to the parrallel channel, type
the following command:


stat rdr:=ur1: 
stat pun:=up1:


To change the rdr: and pun: back to the second serial channel, type the 
following command: 


stat rdr:=ptr:
stat pun:=ptp:


Other possibilities exists, such as changing the console to the second
serial channel (stat con:=crt:) or changing the rdr: and pun: to the
first serial channel (stat rdr:=tty: / stat pun:=tty:), though these
are generally not used.

To change the default device mappings upon coldboot,  set the logical 
device equates in the SUPERBIOS to the physical device that it is to
be associated with and then re-generate the system.  The following shows 
the standard configuration:


lst	equ	pio  shl 6		; printer  device output to pio ch. a-b
pun	equ	siob shl 4		; auxilary device output to sio ch. b
rdr	equ	siob shl 2		; auxilary device input  to sio ch. b
con	equ	sioa shl 0		; console  device i / o  to sio ch. a

iobval	equ	lst+pun+rdr+con		; iobyte setting (always the same)


To change the default printer from the parrallel device to the second 
serial channel, the mapping in the SUPERBIOS should be as follows:


lst	equ	siob shl 6		; printer  device output to sio ch. b
pun	equ	pio  shl 4		; auxilary device output to pio ch. a-b
rdr	equ	pio  shl 2		; auxilary device input  to pio ch. a-b
con	equ	sioa shl 0		; console  device i / o  to sio ch. a

iobval	equ	lst+pun+rdr+con		; iobyte setting (remains the same) 


Of cource, once any changes have been made to the source code, the system
must be re-generated.
