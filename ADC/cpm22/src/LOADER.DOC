                    SUPRBIOS loader operation

     The SUPERBIOS makes use of a system file loader to bring the 
system into memory on a cold boot.  The loader is allowed to be a 
maximum of C80H bytes long.   In the standard implementation, the 
loader  looks  for the file CPM.SYS on floppy drive 0  (that  is, 
that  drive which reponds to the physical line Drive Select 0  ).  
If the file is not present, the loader will respond with an error 
message  to the terminal.   Otherwise,  the loader will load  the 
system   file  into  memory  starting  at  some  buffer  location 
(normally 2000H).  The loader then determines the load address of 
the  CP/M system and blockmoves it to that address.   The  loader 
also  fills in a table in the SUPERBIOS which contains a  map  of 
where on the disk the file CPM.SYS is located.   This information 
is necessary so that the SUPERBIOS can reload the CCP and BDOS on 
a  warm  boot.   That is why you must not change density  on  the 
system  disk if it is a floppy,  since disks of different density 
have  the  CPM.SYS file in different places,  and  changing  disk 
density makes a warm boot impossible.

     The LDRGEN program is the equivalent to SYSGEN in a standard 
system.   It transfers the outer track only from the source  disk 
to  the destination.   After running LDRGEN,  you must transfer a 
valid CPM.SYS file to the disk for it to be bootable.


Customizing the loader:

     The  loader is a .COM file which executes at 100H.   If  you 
wish  to  boot off a disk other than a  floppy  drive,  you  must 
integrate a customized BIOS for the loader.  The BIOS is org'd at 
500H  with a standard BIOS jump table,  and must support  console 
output  and all disk functions except write (for the single  boot 
disk).

     Since the loader is a .COM file, you can debug it by running 
the  loader  as a normal transient program under  your  debugger.  
When  the  custom loader is debugged,  it can be LDRGEN'd onto  a 
disk by passing the filename as a command parameter to LDRGEN:

     LDRGEN B:CUSTMLDR.COM

     The  loader source is included for your use.   The  loagical 
function of the loader in finding a file on the default disk  can 
be  used to support loading of system files from a boot volume to 
a volatile system volume (e.g. a memory disk).  Modify the loader 
so that after the system is loaded and blockmoved,  the  coldboot 
routine  returns to the loader.   Then read the system file  from 
the  boot  volume  and write them to the system disk  using  BDOS 
calls.
